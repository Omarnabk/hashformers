# About

**Hashtag segmentation** is the task of automatically inserting the missing spaces between the words in a hashtag. It can be used to improve tweet sentiment analysis and the automatic translation of tweets.

This package applies Transformer models to hashtag segmentation. It is built on top of the [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library and the [lm-scorer](https://github.com/simonepri/lm-scorer) and [mlm-scoring](https://github.com/awslabs/mlm-scoring) packages.
